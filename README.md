## Introduction
Welcome to the Regex Tutorial! In this tutorial, we will delve into the fascinating world of regular expressions. Regular expressions are a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. They are widely used in text processing, data validation, and programming languages. This tutorial aims to provide you with a solid foundation in regex and equip you with the skills to leverage its power.

## Summary
```md
In this tutorial, we will focus on a specific regex pattern and explore its various components. By understanding these components, you will gain insights into how to construct powerful regex patterns and effectively extract information from text.
```
# Components
```md
Anchors
Anchors are used to match a specific position within the text. They allow you to define where a match should start or end within a line or string.

# Character Classes
Character classes define a set of characters that can be matched at a specific position. They provide a convenient way to match any character from a specified set or range.

# Quantifiers
Quantifiers define how many times a specific element should occur in the text. They allow you to match repeated occurrences of characters, groups, or character classes.

# Grouping and Capturing
Grouping and capturing allow you to create subexpressions within a larger regex pattern. They are used to apply quantifiers, modifiers, or alternation to multiple characters or expressions.

# Alternation
Alternation allows you to match one of several possible patterns. It enables you to specify multiple options and matches the first one that occurs in the text.

# Backreferences
Backreferences allow you to refer back to a previously matched group within the regex pattern. They are useful for matching repeated patterns or enforcing consistency in the text.

# Modifiers
Modifiers are used to change the behavior of a regex pattern. They can specify case insensitivity, global matching, or multiline matching, among other options.

# Metacharacters
Metacharacters have special meanings in regex and allow you to perform advanced matching operations. They include characters like dot (.), caret (^), dollar sign ($), and more.
